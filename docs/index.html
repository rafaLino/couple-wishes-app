    <h1>Wish List Todo App</h1>
    <p>A simple app to keep track of all your wife's wishes — from furniture to fun gifts — so you never lose track
        again!</p>

    <h2>Why I Made This</h2>
    <p>My wife often sends me links of things she wants, but I keep losing track of them in our chat. This app helps me
        save, organize, and manage what I've bought and what I still need to get.</p>

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Save links of wishes quickly</li>
        <li>Mark items as bought or pending</li>
        <li>View all wishes in one place</li>
        <li>Easily update the status of each wish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>Whenever my wife sends me a new wish, I add it to the app. I can then check off items as I buy them, making it
        easy to keep track of everything.</p>

    <h2>Want to Use It?</h2>
    <p>Just add your wishes, mark what you've bought, and stay organized — it's simple and fun!</p>

    <h2>Happy shopping!</h2>
