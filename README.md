# Wish List App

A simple app to keep track of all your wishes â€” so you never lose track again!

## Why I Made This
My wife often sends me links of things she wants, but I keep losing track of them in our chat. This app helps me save, organize, and manage what I've bought and what I still need to get.

## Features
- Save links of wishes quickly
- Mark items as bought or pending
- View all wishes in one place
- Easily update the status of each wish
